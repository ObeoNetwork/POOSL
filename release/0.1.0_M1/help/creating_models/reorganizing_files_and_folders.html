		<h1>Reorganize Files and Folders</h1>
		<p>
		When reorganizing files and folders (copy, paste, delete or rename), the graphical diagrams belonging to the POOSL models also need to be updated.
		This page explains how to do this.
		</p>

		<a id="copy-paste"/><h2>Copy / Paste</h1>
		<p>
		The context menu of the project explorer contains specific actions for copying POOSL models (including their diagrams).
		</p>
		<img src="img/copy.png"/>
		<p>
		Afterwards the paste action for POOSL models (including their diagrams) becomes available.
		</p>
		<img src="img/Paste.png"/>
		<p>
		These actions can be applied to both files and folders.
		For each diagram, all styles and positions are copied.
		</p>

		<a id="delete"/><h2>Delete</h1>
		<p>
		The context menu of the project explorer contains specific actions for deleting POOSL models (including their diagrams).
		</p>
		<img src="img/Delete.png"/>

		<a id="rename"/><h2>Rename</h1>
		<p>
		When renaming a file or folder (e.g., by pressing &lt;F2&gt;) from within Eclipse, the diagrams are automatically updated.
		Note: Eclipse updates the label of graphical editors only after reopening the editor.
		</p>

		<a id="openingaird"/><h2>Inspecting the representations.aird file</h1>
		<p>
		It is possible to inspect the representations.aird file and view all the diagrams inside, but you should avoid the option as much as possible.
		To open the representations.aird file in the project explorer follow the instructions below.
