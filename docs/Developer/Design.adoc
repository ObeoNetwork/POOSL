= Design of POOSL IDE

== Editors and Loaded resources

=== Xtext editor

Each editor has a specific ResourceSet for a specific file.

=== Sirius editor

Due to Modeling nature, 1 ResourceSet is defined per project. +
This is an unbalanced choice that can lead to a lot of conflict combinations.


== Flexible Basic Classes declaration

[CAUTION]
====
Required investigation: +
How resourceset deals with Basic Classes setting ?
====

Sirius Session can have issue with such mechanism as semantic elements are always traced in AIRD.

To propagate Basic classes change, preference page triggers 'clean-build' on workspace.

It is unlikely, Sirius Session will reload the model on such event.
