[![gh-actions status](https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/POOSL/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/POOSL/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

This is a temporary repository to prepare POOSL IDE to go to the Eclipse Foundation. Do not refer to this repository as it will soon disappear.

# Brief introduction to the POOSL project

The Parallel Object-Oriented Specification Language (POOSL) is a very expressive language to model 
concurrent hardware/software systems. POOSL has a small set of powerful primitives and it has an 
unambiguous formal semantics in terms of mathematical axioms and rules. POOSL models can be 
simulated with the Rotalumis simulator. 

This project provides an Eclipse-based tool for editing and debugging POOSL models.

## How to install
[Installation guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ObeoNetwork/POOSL/main/docs/User/InstallationManual.pdf) 
helps you to install Eclipse and POOSL features.


## How to download Eclipse Features

Update site and help are accessible on <a 
href="https://obeonetwork.github.io/POOSL" >gh-pages site</a>.


## How to build

Here you will find a introduction how to setup, build and run tests.

### Preconditions

We assume the following tools/frameworks are available

- JDK 11 (JDK 16 or above is not supported for now)
- Maven 3.5+
- rcptt ide: is the IDE for RCPTT development 
- rcptt runner 2.5.0: is the command line tool for RCPTT 
- ${POOSL_SRC} stands for the poosl source location on your host

### Command
To build the poosl project via maven you have to go run the following commands.

```
cd ${POOSL_SRC}
mvn clean verify
```

Executing this command will build the plugins, features, updatesite and products.

### Locations
Update site is available at __${POOSL_SRC}/releng/org.eclipse.poosl.update/target/repository__
Product are available at __${POOSL_SRC}/releng/org.eclipse.poosl.product/target/products__



## Automatic Tests via RCPTT (__Currently under refactoring__)

We have different ways of running the tests

- Running in a _Jenkins_ environment
- Running as command line tool
- Running with _maven_
- Running with the _rcptt ide_

All the needed tests and scripts are available at __${POOSL_SRC}\RCPTT__. 

### Preconditions

- jdk 11 is available
- Only if running the scripts (not via maven)
    - rcptt test runner is available at __C:\opt\rcptt\rcptt.runner-2.5.0__
- eclipse runtime is available at __C:\opt\eclipse\eclipse-2019-12\eclipse__ and setup properly


### Running tests

To run the tests in a _Jenkins_ environment or as command line you will find the proper scripts in the poosl repository.

#### The generic workflow to run the scripts are:

1. Checkout the poosl source+scripts into __${MY_FOLDER}/poosl__
1. Build the plugins as descript above.
1. We can assume the build plugin artifacts are located in __${MY_FOLDER}/poosl/org.eclipse.poosl.update/target/repository__, which is the case after you do the build.
1. Run one of the 
    * scripts: ``{MY_FOLDER}/poosl/RCPTT/runnerScripts/*.cmd``
    * maven: ``mvn clean package -f __${MY_FOLDER}/poosl/RCPTT/runnerScripts/pom-*.xml``
1. Check the results
    * scripts results in __${MY_FOLDER}/result__
    * maven results in __${MY_FOLDER}/rcptt-target__

#### Running with Jenkins

The scripts are developed to run within _Jenkins_ out of the box.

You can follow the generic running tests instructions above where __${MY_FOLDER}__ is automtically set to _Jenkins workspace_

#### Running as Command

To run the test as command line you can follow the generic workflow described above.
