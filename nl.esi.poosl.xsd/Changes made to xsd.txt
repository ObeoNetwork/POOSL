This document contains all the changes to the xsd's of rotalumis for use with java's xjc class generation tool.
There is also 1 important change made in rotalumis. Because xjc generates namespace aware classes all xml documents must refer to that used namespace.
Rotalumis did not reply to messages with a namespace so the namespace uri:poosl has been added to all response xmls.
In the future it would be better to split the namespace of poosl and rotalumis!

Rotalumis API request changes to XSD:
	
	* t_load_request
		* changed "filename" element to attribute
		
	* t_save_request
		* changed elements to minoccurs="1"/maxoccurs="1" instead of use="required"
		  the last one can only be used on attributes and not on elements
		  
	* t_command_request
		* changed "type" element to attribute
	
	* changed all occurences of type t_handle to xs:integer
		* t_handle contains an element with an ID and an element with a type.
		  what rotalumis actually returns is just 1 element with the handleID
	
Rotalumis API response changes to XSD:
	
	* t_file_io_result
		* changed enum "ok" to "OK"
		  possibly other enums in this list are also wrong
		  
	* t_class_with_handle
		* changed "name" element to "class_name" to fix class generation error
		
	* t_command_response
		* changed "result" attribute to element
		
	* t_inspect_response
		* commented out 2 elements because they are not present in actual response from rotalumis
		
	* t_execution_state_change_response
		* commented out 1 element because it is not present in actual response from rotalumis
		
	* changed the type "t_stack_frame" to "t_stack_trace_frame"
		* xjc ignores underscores so t_stack_frame == t_stackframe and both are used in the xsd
	
	* changed all occurences of type t_handle to xs:integer
		* t_handle contains an element with an ID and an element with a type.
		  what rotalumis actually returns is just 1 element with the handleID
		  
PooslModel changes to XSD:
	
	* removed the hex_integer, binary_integer and octal_integer from the constant_type enumeration because there are not used.
	* changed list_of_statements into t_statements
	* removed the t_sequence_of_statements	
	* added sequence_of_statements to t_statements to allow for recursive sequence_of_statements
