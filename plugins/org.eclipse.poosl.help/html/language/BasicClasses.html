It represents an indexed list of (arbitrary typed) objects. Creating a new Array yields an indexed list of size 0 (empty Array).

Otherwise, it returns false.</p><p><h4>+(a:  Array):  Array</h4>Returns a new Array consisting of a copy of the receiver that has the size of the receiver plus the size of a, where the indices between 1 and the size of the receiver are filled with the objects in the receiver (in the same order) and the indices between the size of the receiver + 1 and the size of the returned Array contain the objects in a (in the same order). It has a special syntax of the form a1 + a2, where a1 acts as the receiver and a2 as the argument.</p><p><h4>deepCopy():  Object</h4>Returns a new Array object with the same size as the receiver and at each index, a recursive deepCopy of the object referred to by the receiver at that index.</p><p><h4>shallowCopy():  Object</h4>Returns a new Array object with the same size as the receiver and at each index, it refers to the same object referred to by the receiver at that index.</p><p><h4>printString():  String</h4>Returns a String equal to "Empty Array" in case the receiver has size 0. Otherwise, it consists of String "Array(" followed by a comma separated list of Strings, the result s of calling printString on the objects from index 1 to the size of the receiver, followed by ")".</p><p><h4>at(i:  Integer):  Object</h4>Returns the object located at index i in case i ranges between 1 and the size the receiver. Otherwise, an index out-of-bounds error is generated.</p><p><h4>size():  Integer</h4>Returns the size of the receiver.</p><p><h4>putAt(i:  Integer, o:  Object):  Array</h4>Replaces the object at index i with o in case i ranges between 1 and the size of the receiver.

It returns the receiver.</p><p><h4>resize(i:  Integer):  Array</h4>Modifies the size of the receiver to i (in case i >= 0). In case i < 0, an error is generated. When i is larger than the original size of the receiver, all new locations are filled with nil. When i is smaller than the original size of the receiver, the objects at indices between i+1 and the original size will no longer be contained. It returns the receiver.</p><p><h4>concat(a:  Array):  Array</h4>Modifies the receiver by increasing its size with the size of a, where the indices between the size of the receiver + 1 and the size of the returned Array contain the objects in a (in the same order).</p><p><h4>find(i:  Integer, o:  Object):  Integer</h4>This method searches the receiver for object o, starting from index i. If an object equal to o is found, the index (between 1 and the size of the receiver) at which o is located is returned.

In all other cases, it returns 0.</p><p><h4>subArray(i:  Integer, l:  Integer):  Array</h4>Returns a new Array of size l containing a copy of the objects in the receiver starting at index i in case i is between 1 and the size of the receiver, l is non-negative and i + l-1 is at most equal to the size of the receiver.

In case a file with destination indicated by s already exists, that particular file is emptied. It returns the receiver.</p><p><h4>open():  FileOut</h4>(Re-)opens the referred file for write access. Performing such write accesses will result in first clearing all existing information in the file (if any).

It therefore provides generic methods that are applicable to all data objects.<h3>Variables:</h3><div class="indented"></div><h3>Methods:</h3><div class="indented"><p><h4>!=(o:  Object):  Boolean</h4>Returns true in case o is not equal to the receiver and false otherwise. The result is equivalent to (receiver = o) not. It has a special syntax of the form o1 != o2, where o1 acts as the receiver and o2 as the argument</p><p><h4>!==(o:  Object):  Boolean</h4>Returns true in case o is not identical to the receiver and false otherwise. The result is equivalent to: (receiver == o) not. It has a special syntax of the form o1 !== o2, where o1 acts as the receiver and o2 as the argument.</p><p><h4>=(o:  Object):  Boolean</h4>Implements the equality relation. For primitive objects (except for Float value nan), = is equivalent to ==. For user-defined classes, it returns true if o is an object of the same class as the receiver and all instance variables of o and the receiver are (recursively) equal as well. Otherwise, it returns false. For non-primitive native classes, the behavior is as defined for the user-defined classes, unless specified differently at the description of the class.

This means that a new instance of the receiver's class is returned, where each instance variable is assigned to clones in a recursive manner, such that all (indirect) references to the same original object result in references to a single cloned object. The original and cloned data object structures are isomorphic. For primitive classes, the receiver itself is returned. The non-permanent native classes (and any user-defined subclasses) do not support copying and therefore, an error is generated. For non-primitive permanent classes, the behavior is as defined for the user-defined classes, unless specified differently at the description of the class.</p><p><h4>error(s:  String):  Object</h4>This method allows to signal erroneous behavior.

Semantically it does nothing, but tools tend to halt execution of a model after this method when expression b evaluates to false and show message s to the user.</p><p><h4>marshal():  String</h4>Returns a standardized String representation of the receiver. The inverse functionality is implemented as method unmarshal in class String. It can for example be used to communicate arbitrary objects between different POOSL models via files or sockets in a standardized way.</p><p><h4>printString():  String</h4>Returns a String representation of the receiver. It is the typical means used by tools to retrieve a representation of an object to users of those tools. The standard behavior in class Object returns just the class name. This is overridden in subclasses to display more specific information on the object. If the receiver is an instance of a primitive class or class String, the syntactic constant representation of the receiver is returned.</p><p><h4>shallowCopy():  Object</h4>For user-defined classes not extending non-permanent native classes, it returns a shallow copy of the receiver. This means that a new object of the receiver's class is created, for which the instance variables refer to the same objects as the corresponding instance variables of the receiver. For primitive classes, the receiver itself is returned. For non-permanent native classes (and any user-defined subclasses), an error is generated. For non-primitive permanent classes, the behavior is as defined for the user-defined classes, unless specified differently at the description of the class.</p><p><h4>isOfType(s:  String):  Boolean</h4>If s does not refer to the name of an existing data class, an error is generated.

It can be used to monitor the simulated system and it provides a means for POOSL tools to terminate an execution or interact with other tools based on observation results. Creating a new Observer yields an unregistered observer object. While unregistered it has no effect on execution of a model. Registering an Observer makes it relevant in the condition to terminate the execution. In case method complete has been called for all Observer instances in a POOSL model since their registration (and there is at least one registered Observer), the execution terminates. Execution also terminates when method halt is called for any registered Observer.<h3>Variables:</h3><div class="indented"></div><h3>Methods:</h3><div class="indented"><p><h4>identifyWith(s:  String):  Observer</h4>Sets the Observer’s human-readable identity to s.</p><p><h4>identity():  String</h4>Returns the Observer’s identity.</p><p><h4>result():  String</h4>This method returns a String representation of the results for the monitored property. Tools typically use it to communicate observer state to external tools. By default, the result of method printString is returned. Method result can be overridden in subclasses to return specific information on the monitored properties.</p><p><h4>register():  Observer</h4>Marks the Observer to be relevant for terminating the simulation. If the Observer executed the complete method before, it is only considered activated until it executes the complete method again.</p><p><h4>deregister():  Observer</h4>Marks the Observer to be irrelevant for terminating the simulation.</p><p><h4>complete():  Observer</h4>Marks the Observer as activated to terminate the simulation.
