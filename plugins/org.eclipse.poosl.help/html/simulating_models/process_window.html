		<h1>Process window</h1>
		<p>
		Process windows can be created from the <a href="debug_view.html">Debug view</a>. They persist after termination of a simulation and are reused when restarting a simulation. Process windows are only visible in the POOSL Debug perspective.	
		</p>
		<img src="img/process_window.png"/>
		<p>
		A process window consists of 2 views:		
		<ol>
			<li><a href="execution_tree_view.html">Execution Tree view</a>
			<li><a href="variables_view.html">Variables view</a></li>			
		</ol>
		In a process window, these views are restricted to a specific process. The title of the window consists of the model name and the process name.
		Multiple process windows can be used to monitor multiple processes at the same time.
