		<h1>Change Propagation</h1>
		<p>
		Change propagation across <a href="../language/Imports.html">imports</a> provides the following features:
		<ul>
			<li>When a file is edited, any depending files are re-validated;</li>
			<li>When an element is renamed, any depending files are updated accordingly.</li>
		</ul>
		The effectiveness of these mechanisms depends on whether all files are in open Eclipse projects.
		</p>

		<h2>All files are in open Eclipse projects</h2>
		<p>
		Change propagation works on such files as long as all changes are made using the Poosl IDE.
		After any changes made outside of the Poosl IDE, please refresh (F5) the corresponding project in Eclipse to re-validate any depending files.
		</p>

		<h2>Some files are outside open Eclipse projects</h2>
		<p>
		Such files are not tracked by the Poosl IDE.
		After any changes, please perform Project -> Clean...  to re-validate any depending files.
