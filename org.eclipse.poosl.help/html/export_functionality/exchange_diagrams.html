		<h1>Exchange and Backup POOSL Models and Diagrams</h1>
		<p>
		The graphical POOSL diagrams are not stored inside a poosl file, but in the representations.aird file. 
		Each project has one representations.aird file that contains all diagrams from the project.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Exchanging POOSL models including their diagrams</h2>	
		<p>
		The easiest way to exchange models and diagrams with other POOSL users is as follows:
		<ol>		
			<li><a href="../creating_models/creating_models.html#create_project">Create a new POOSL project</a> in the same workspace as the original project
			<li><a href="../creating_models/reorganizing_files_and_folders.html#copy-paste">Copy (including diagrams)</a> the file(s) or folder(s) from the original project 
			<li><a href="../creating_models/reorganizing_files_and_folders.html#copy-paste">Paste (including diagrams)</a> the file(s) or folder(s) into the new project
			<li><a href="export.html#archive">Export the project</a> from the current workspace
			<li><a href="export.html#import-archive">Import the project</a> into someone the other POOSL users' workspace
		</ol>
