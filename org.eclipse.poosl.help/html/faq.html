		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Running or debugging a model gives validation errors, but they are not shown in the editor.
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> If the editor reports no validation errors, but running or debugging the model reports errors, then there might be a problem with the line endings of the files. To solve this problem, save the file with windows line endings. This problem is often caused by Linux line endings.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why does the type system produce warnings instead of errors?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> In POOSL models, the types of variables and parameters have no formal meaning; basically they are just pieces of documentation. When invoking a data method or operation, at simulation time the types of variables are determined. This means that it is impossible to perform a 100% correct type check while editing; therefore any data type related issues are reported while editing as warnings.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why are some obvious suggestions missing in the content assist?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> The content assist depends on the current context, which may be wrong if the model contains grammatical errors (such as a missing semi-colon ';'). Solve these errors before using the content assist.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why does a certain quick-fix have no effect?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> Executing a quick-fix sometimes has no effect on the model. This can be caused by other errors that are still present in the model that are related to applied quick-fix. Solve these errors before executing the quick-fix.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why does "Help -> Check for Updates" not show any updates for Rotalumis?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> Updates for the POOSL IDE and Rotalumis plugins are released independently. To make sure that you are notified of Rotalumis updates, check that Rotalumis occurs in Help -> About Eclipse -> Installation Details -> Installed Software. If Rotalumis does not occur, please explicitly install Rotalumis (from the POOSL IDE update site); see the installation manual.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What can I do about "OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" or "GC overhead limit exceeded"?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> The Eclipse installation folder contains a file eclipse.ini, which most likely contains a fragment like "-Xmx512m". This indicates that the maximum Java heap size is 512 megabyte. Increasing this amount (e.g., doubling it) should solve this problem. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What can I do about "java.lang.StackOverflowError"?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> The Eclipse installation folder contains a file eclipse.ini, which can be extended with a fragment like "-Xss4m". This indicates that the Java stack size is 4 megabyte. Adding this fragment, or increasing the amount (e.g., doubling it) should solve this problem. 
		</p>	

		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What can I do if the step buttons are disabled during a debug session?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> Select a process or cluster in the <a href="simulating_models/debug_view.html">Debug View</a>. Or, reset the POOSL Debug perspective, by right-clicking in the top-right corner on the "POOSL Debug" perspective and selecting Reset.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What can I do if the step buttons are invisible during a debug session?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> Reset the POOSL Debug perspective, by right-clicking in the top-right corner on the "POOSL Debug" perspective and selecting Reset. Or, switch to the "POOSL Edit" perspective and afterwards back to the "POOSL Debug" perspective.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What can I do about "Zero representations file found in "...". A modeling project must contain one."?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> This means that the project has a modeling nature but does not contain an .aird file. The Modeling nature and .aird file are needed for graphical editing and are automatically added when opening a graphical editor.
		</br>There are 2 ways to fix this error:
		<ol>
			<li>Remove the representations.aird: 
			<br>See the next question <a href="faq.html#removeaird">What is the file representations.aird, and how can I remove it?</a>.
			<li>Open a graphical editor:
			<br>It doesn't matter which diagram you open, the representations.aird file will automatically be generated. To open a class diagram right click a .poosl file and select "Open Class Diagram". 
			</li>			
		</ol>
		</p>

		<p>
		<b id="removeaird">Q:</b> What is the file representations.aird, and how can I remove it?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> The .aird file stores the graphical model information, and is automatically added when opening a graphical editor. To remove this file, first remove the Modeling nature from the project by right clicking the project in the Project Explorer -> Configure -> Remove Modeling Project Nature. If "Remove Modeling Project Nature" is not present, then the Modeling nature has already been removed.
		Once the Modeling nature is removed, you can safely remove the representations.aird file: right click the representation.aird and select delete.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What can I do about "The system cannot find the path specified" when trying to run or debug a model?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> This can mean that Eclipse has restricted access in the Eclipse installation folder. To solve this issue, either run Eclipse as administrator (Right-click on eclipse.exe, select "Run as administrator"), or move the Eclipse installation folder to a location where it has full read and write access.`
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What can I do about a grey or red cross in the editor's sidebar or project explorer, when there is no error shown in the file (editor)?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> This can happen when the validation mechanisms of Eclipse are out of sync. Forcing a new validation of the file can solve this issue. 
		This can be done by making a small adjustment (like adding a space) to the file and then save it. If this does not solve the problem, go to Project -> Clean -> select your project -> OK, which will force a validation of the whole project.
		</p>	
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What can I do about errors and warnings that seem not correct, or opening the declaration of an object (&lt;F3>) navigates to the wrong object?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> This can happen when the validation and linking mechanisms of Eclipse are out of sync.
		Open the Project menu, and make sure that the option "Build Automatically" is activated (indicated by a checkmark in front of it). If it is not activated, click on "Build Automatically" to activate it.
		</p>			
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why can't I find the importing and exporting functionality for legacy (SHESim) XML files?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> The legacy support is part of a <a href="export_functionality/legacy.html#install-legacy">separate plugin</a>, which may not have installed. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> How can I run a POOSL model from the command line?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> This is explained at <a href="http://poosl.esi.nl/download/">http://poosl.esi.nl/download/</a>.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Are there any known issues with the POOSL IDE?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> To access our issue tracker, please consult the <a href="http://poosl.esi.nl/support">support</a> page on our website.
		</br>The main known issues are:
		<ul>
			<li>when connecting an instance port to a channel, the location of the port in the graphical editor is not preserved;
			<li>when reordering elements in the textual editor, the layout in the graphical editor is not preserved;
			<li>when using automatic layout in the graphical editor, the channel trajectory is usually non-optimal.
			<li>on some machines the Composite Structure Diagram only shows the port names after changing the size of the port in the diagram.
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why do I have an 'incorrect' error on my import that shows that classes are already imported?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> This can happen when importing the same file with a relative and an absolute path. 
		The model will see this as two different files which then import the same classes. To avoid the issue use the same format throughout the model.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why can't I use &lt;F3> or &lt;CTRL> + left-mouse-click in the textual editor to navigate to certain data classes or methods?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> Navigation is not possible to files that do not exist in the project. 
		In particular this may happen when trying to navigate to data classes or methods from <a href="language/BasicClasses.html">BasicClasses.poosl</a>. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why can't I see the Poosl Include Paths in the Project Properties?
		<br>
		<b>A:</b>This can happen when the project is not configured as an Xtext project. 
		To add the Xtext configuration to the project, right click the project in the Project Explorer -> Configure -> Convert to Xtext Project. 
		The Poosl Include Paths should now be visible in the Project properties.
