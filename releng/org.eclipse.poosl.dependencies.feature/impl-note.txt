Notes on dependencies:

* egit dependencies to jgit are not transitive. There is jgit global feature (pgm is not complete).

* org.eclipse.eef plugin is only available through SDK feature.

* org.eclipse.acceleo feature 
 - is available on Eclipse release but not Sirius/update.
 - includes 
   + doc (useless)
   + ide.ui requiring 'pde'; This is really annoying.
 => no feature found for runtime with only query, model, parser.

* org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui is available through org.eclipse.sirius.runtime.ide.ui.
  Doesn't '.sirius.runtime.ide.ui' contain to many elements ?
