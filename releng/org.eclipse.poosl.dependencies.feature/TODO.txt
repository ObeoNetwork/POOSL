Notes on dependencies:

* org.eclipse.xtext.generator would not be part of the product if MWE2 was not in 'xtext' project.

* egit dependencies are not transitive (TBC).

* org.eclipse.eef plugin is only available through SDK feature.

* org.eclipse.acceleo feature is available on Eclipse release but not Sirius/update.

* org.eclipse.acceleo includes 
 doc (useless)
 ide.ui requiring 'pde'; This is really annoying
 => no feature found for runtime with only query, model, parser

* org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui is available through org.eclipse.sirius.runtime.ide.ui.
  Don't *sirius.runtime.ide.ui contains to many elements ?
