This is a temporary repository to prepare POOSL IDE to go to the Eclipse Foundation. 
Be aware this repository as it will soon disappear.

= Brief introduction to the POOSL project

The Parallel Object-Oriented Specification Language (POOSL) is a very expressive language to model 
concurrent hardware/software systems. POOSL has a small set of powerful primitives and it has an 
unambiguous formal semantics in terms of mathematical axioms and rules. POOSL models can be 
simulated with the Rotalumis simulator. 

This project provides an Eclipse-based tool for editing and debugging POOSL models.
